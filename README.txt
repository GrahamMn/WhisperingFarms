Whispering Farms – RPG

Whispering Farms is a cozy role-playing game that puts you into the shoes of a new farmer who has just inherited the family farm, except this isn’t an ordinary homestead. On your very first morning, as you water your newly planted seeds, they surprise you by striking up a conversation. From “thank yous” after each watering to updates on their growth, the plants have a personality of their own. Your overarching goal is to unravel the mystery behind their liveliness, though in this initial prototype the deeper discovery mechanics are still not developed yet with the timeframe I had.

At its heart, Whispering Farms is my interpretation of the “everything is alive” theme. By giving the plants their own voice, I wanted to bridge the gap between the natural world and classic farming simulation. I have always loved the relaxed pace and hidden depth of games like ‘Stardew Valley’ and ‘Animal Crossing’ and putting a fun twist on that by giving the plants life makes it feel that much more whimsical.

The gameplay is simple. Just press W, A, S, or D to wander across the farm. You can hit TAB to open your inventory and click once on the icon you want to equip and again to unequip or stow them away.  If you hit Escape it brings up the pause menu; when it's time to sell your harvest, walk on over to the shop stall and press E in front of the shopkeeper. This will open the shop menu where you can buy and sell items. Equipping your watering can or hoe works the same way. Select it in your inventory, then use E to till soil or water the crops. You can also use E at the front door of the house to enter your room. I did not implement anything to do in the house. It took a long time to make it for everything to be saved between scenes, so I did not have the time to do a sleep menu like I planned. The asset I used was from M studio hub. It only came with sprites and no demo scene, so I had to build the scenes, player animation, and prefabs myself.

Although this build focuses on the talking plants I am excited to expand on the game and expand more on the discovery features! I also plan to incorporate a town scene so you can have even more interaction with people to see if anyone knows anything about your talking farm. I also want to incorporate a crafting table where you can collect plants and wood to make your own tools and decor for your farm.
